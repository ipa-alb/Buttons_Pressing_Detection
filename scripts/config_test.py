#@brief Define the global variable that the Button Pressing Detection is using.
# You are defining the name of the databases where you want to write and the position of the button in the robot cell and their port on the Rpi
# We made a button class. Each button is an instance of the Button_Definition class.
# @section notes_configuration Notes
# We define the parameter of the button in this configuration file such as:
#   - the socket server port and host
#   - the Button area that is to be working: 
#   - the parameter that are thought to be useful to work on
#   - the real_time_processing 
#   - the time the Button_Pressing_Detection application is running
#
# @section todo_config
# Find a way to define the parameter on only one device. For now, the button instance are created on the computer and on the Rpi, but it would be better to
# open the socket communication. Once this socket communication is open, we create the buttons classes on only one device, and export it to the other device via 
# the socket.
